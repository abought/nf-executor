Mock workflow. Used to verify logging features.

## Running the workflow
```bash
$ nextflow run hello.nf -name insert_id_here -with-weblog http://127.0.0.1:8000/workflows/insert_id_here/report/ -with-report sample-report.html -with-trace

$ nextflow log insert_i_here
$ nextflow clean -f
```

## Replaying a captured event stream
The payloads generated by `-with-weblog` have been captured to a JSON file to allow debugging without a full workflow run. These may be replayed to the server using the simple script:

`python3 replay.py`

This requires first running the FastAPI application. Additional features may be added in the future.
