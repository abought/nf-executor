Mock workflow. Used to verify logging features.

## Running the workflow
**Note**: This string is an example. The actual reporter URL may vary, eg if authentication is needed. For best event capture results, run workflow from within the actual Django app.

```bash
JOB_ID="job-`date "+%F-%H-%M-%S"`"
nextflow run hello.nf -name $JOB_ID -with-weblog "http://127.0.0.1:8000/workflows/$JOB_ID/report/" -with-report sample-report.html -with-trace

nextflow log $JOB_ID
nextflow clean -f
```

## Replaying a captured event stream
The payloads generated by `-with-weblog` have been captured to a JSON file to allow debugging without a full workflow run. These may be replayed to the server using the simple script:

`python3 replay.py`

This requires first running the FastAPI application. Additional features may be added in the future.
